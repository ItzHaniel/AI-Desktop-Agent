They both have a morbid fascination with the killers they're pursuing, which raises questions about the nature of evil and the human condition.\n\nBoth shows also feature a brilliant, calculating villain (Dexter's Trinity Killer and Hannibal Lecter) who is more than just a one-dimensional monster. They're charismatic, sophisticated, and even, in a twisted way, relatable.\n\nThe atmosphere and tone of both shows are also similar, with a focus on the darker corners of human psychology and the blurred lines between good and evil.\n\nBut what really sets Hannibal apart is its exploration of the fragility of the human psyche. The show delves deeper into the emotional and psychological scars of its characters, making it a more introspective and thought-provoking experience.\n\nWhat do you think is the main difference between the two shows, and which one do you think is more",
